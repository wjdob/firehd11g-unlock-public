# Why this exists: on this firmware persist.sys.saved_time is NOT durable.
# Amazon's TimeService NTP-syncs ~20 s and ~130 s into boot and writes the synced
# millisecond clock into that property, overwriting the armed trigger. The
# consequence is a silent alternating-boot failure -- the trigger is armed for
# the current boot, NTP makes it numeric, and the NEXT boot's
# load_persist_props_action finds nothing to evaluate, so no uid-0 waiter runs
# while the actor still reports success. Measured on device:
#   TimeService.clockWrapper: broadcastTimeUpdate ... newTimeMillis = 1791389093870
# which is byte-for-byte the value left in the property.
#
# Polling every 2 s rather than restoring once is deliberate: a single restore
# would race an NTP write at an unknown moment, whereas polling keeps the value
# armed at every instant, so whichever moment the device reboots, the next boot
# fires. Cost is one getprop per 2 s.
#
# INSTALLED BY ROOT, EXECUTED BY THE UID-1000 ACTOR. It deliberately does not
# live in the actor's scratch directory: that directory is 0777 (the actor has to
# write native_result into it) and executing a script from a world-writable
# directory would let any local app replace it and run code as uid 1000 -- which
# is a straight path back to re-arming root. This file is root-owned 0755 in a
# root-owned 0755 directory, so the actor can run it but not modify it.
#
# "Armed at every instant" is the design intent, not a measured guarantee: the
# loop has a gap between the check and the sleep, and an NTP write landing in
# that gap is only corrected on the next tick. That is exactly why the boot actor
# retries the carrier in-boot (see PersistenceService.java) instead of assuming
# the trigger survived.

# One guard per boot. A second guard would double the property traffic and could

# The pidfile records the BOOT ID on the first line and the PID on the second.
# A PID alone is not safe here: this file lives on /data and survives reboots, so
# a PID recycled by an unrelated process in the next boot would make `kill -0`
# succeed and the real guard would exit without ever arming -- a dead watchdog
# that looks alive. Requiring the boot id to match as well removes that
# coincidence entirely.
